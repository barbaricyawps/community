## Agenda and notes

- **Welcome any newcomers**
- **AMA about unit testing with Pedro**
  - It turns out that Pedro wasn't able to make it today, so we'll reschedule this session, most likely for next time.
- **Recap from last week**
  - In our last meeting, we talked about Max Arnold's proposal for adding metadata structure files to the extensions. See https://github.com/max-arnold/salt-extensions-metadata/
  - The main debate was over whether to keep centralized metadata or distributed metadata (or a combo of both). Did that resolve? Any additional thoughts?
- **Module documentation quality project**
  - Alyssa worked for awhile on a module documentation quality project. See https://saltstack.gitlab.io/open/docs/docs-hub/topics/module-doc-standards/index.html
  - She can describe that project and talk about whether it has applicability for the extensions project.

## Next steps

- TBD
